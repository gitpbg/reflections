How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced ?
Narrowed down the source code to only the lines that were changed.  This helped see the bug easily.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term ?
1) See the history of changes in approach, design decisions.
2) see the bugs that were fixed over time.
3) get an idea of how the code developed over time, how features were added.
4) Can agressively remove cruft from the code.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
You decide on the granularity of the submit.
The code is always logically complete and saved on logical boundaries
If you lose your disk or file then you lose all the changes made since your last commit
